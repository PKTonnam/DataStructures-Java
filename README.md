# Java Data Structures 📊

This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures and algorithms developed during lab sessions in the second year of the 'Data Structure and Algorithms for Software Engineering' course. Each implementation demonstrates fundamental concepts and operations associated with the respective data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures Implemented 🏗️

- **ArrayList**: A resizable array implementation that allows dynamic resizing and efficient access to elements.
- **LinkedList**: A singly linked list implementation that supports efficient insertions and deletions.
- **DoublyLinkedList**: A doubly linked list implementation that allows traversal in both directions.
- **CircularQueueArray**: An implementation of a circular queue using an array for efficient enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **CircularQueueLink**: A circular queue implemented using a linked list.
- **Stack Implementations**:
  - **Stack using ArrayList**: A stack implementation that uses an ArrayList as the underlying data structure.
  - **Stack using Doubly Linked List**: A stack implementation using a doubly linked list.
  - **Infix to Postfix Conversion**: A stack-based approach to convert infix expressions to postfix.
- **Queue Implementations**:
  - **Queue using Array**: A basic queue implementation using an array.
  - **Queue using Linked List**: A queue implementation using a linked list.

## Sorting Algorithms 🔢

This repository includes various sorting algorithms implemented in Java:

- **Insertion Sort**: 🔄
- **Selection Sort**: 🔄
- **Bubble Sort**: 🔄
- **Shell Sort**: 🔄
- **Merge Sort**: 🔄
- **Quick Sort**: 🔄

## Searching Algorithms 🔍

This repository includes various searching algorithms implemented in Java:

- **Sequential Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks every element in the list.
- **Binary Search**: An efficient search algorithm that works on sorted lists.
- **Hashing**: An introduction to hashing techniques for efficient data retrieval.

## Testing ✔️

Each data structure and algorithm implementation is accompanied by JUnit tests to ensure functionality and reliability. The tests validate the correctness of operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, sorting, and traversal.
